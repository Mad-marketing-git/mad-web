# MAD Web React Migration

This project was bootstrapped with Vite and React. It is intended for migrating the previous HTML/CSS/JS site to a modular React codebase.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Structure
- `src/` contains React components and assets.
- Use modular CSS or styled-components for styling.
- Place images in `src/assets/`.

## Migration Plan
- Convert each HTML section into a React component.
- Move interactive features (sliders, modals, etc.) to React logic.
- Use routing if needed for multi-page navigation.

## Notes
- Replace placeholder images with final assets as needed.
- For more details on Vite + React, see [Vite Documentation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/).
